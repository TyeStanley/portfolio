# Tye's Portfolio

## Description

Hello my name is Tye and this is my own portfolio. I've made it to keep a collection of all my future projects all neatly organized together in one place. My portfolio currently has 2 other projects within it all with responsive design for a mobile friendly experience. What you will find on my portfolio is a section dedicated talking a little bit about me. If you are interested in learning a bit more feel free to visit. Under the work section will be where you'll have access to all of my projects. Near the bottom is my contact information as well.
